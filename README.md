# How to start the program

There two executable runnables provided in the repository: udpserver.jar and client.jar

Transfer the server jar to the endhost you'd like to use as server and the client to the endhost you'd like to use as client.
Then open a terminal in the folder you have stored the jar in and type java -jar <name>.jar to execute.
  
There is no need for any arguments.
